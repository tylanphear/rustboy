This is an for the original Gameboy, written in Rust, intended to help myself
learn more about emulation and Gameboy hardware. An attempt is made to be as
accurate and efficient as possible (in that order). Not all bugs/behaviors have
been implemented so far; only those essential to running most games. Currently
runs most games with full sound/graphics with minimal lag (on my machine ;)

Progress so far (estimated):
    - Emulation:
        - CPU: 95/100
        - PPU: 90/100
        - APU: 80/100
        - MMU: 80/100
            - Mappers: 50/100
    - UI: ??/100
    - Debug: ??
